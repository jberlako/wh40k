[b]++ Roster Rules ++[/b]


. [b]Daemonic Ritual:[/b] Instead of moving in their Movement phase, any CHAOS CHARACTER can, at the end of their Movement phase, attempt to summon a DAEMON unit with this ability by performing a Daemonic Ritual (the character cannot do so if they arrived as reinforcements this turn, or if they themselves have been summoned to the battlefield this turn).

If they do, first choose one of the four Chaos Gods - KHORNE, TZEENTCH, NURGLE, or SLAANESH. A CHARACTER who owes allegiance to one of the Dark Gods can only attempt to summon the units of their patron - for example, a KHORNE CHARACTER could only attempt to summon KHORNE DAEMONS.

Roll up to 3 dice - this is your summoning roll. You can summon one new unit with the Daemonic Ritual ability to the battlefield that has a Power Rating equal to or less than the total result so long as it has the same Chaos God keyword you chose at the start. This unit is treated as reinforcements for your army and can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within 12" of the character and is more than 9" from any enemy model. If the total rolled is insufficient to summon any unit, the ritual fails and no new unit is summoned.

If your summoning roll included any doubles, your character then suffers a mortal wound. If it contained any triples, it instead suffers D3 mortal wounds. ()

. [b]Despoilers of the Galaxy (*No Legion Trait*):[/b] If your army is Battle-forged, all Troops units in Chaos Space Marine Detachments gain this ability. Such a unit that is within range of an objective marker (as specified in the mission) controls that objective marker even if there are more enemy models within range of it. If an enemy unit within range of the same objective marker has a similar ability, then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range as normal. ()

. [b]Daemonic Ritual:[/b] Instead of moving in their Movement phase, any CHAOS CHARACTER can, at the end of their Movement phase, attempt to summon a DAEMON unit with this ability by performing a Daemonic Ritual (the character cannot do so if they arrived as reinforcements this turn, or if they themselves have been summoned to the battlefield this turn). 

If they do so, first choose one of the four Chaos Gods - KHORNE, TZEENTCH, NURGLE, or SLAANESH. A CHARACTER who owes allegiance to one of the Dark Gods can attempt to summon the units of their patron - for example, a KHORNE CHARACTER could only attempt to summon KHORNE DAEMONS. 

Roll up to 3 dice - this is your summoning roll. You can summon one new unit with the Daemonic Ritual ability to the battlefield that has a Power Rating equal to or less than the total result so long as it has the same Chaos God keyword you chose at the start (in the case of units that have the choice of allegiance, such as Furies, the unit when summoned will have this keyword.) This unit is treated as reinforcements for your army and can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is entirely within 12" of the character and more than 9" from any enemy model. If the total rolled is insufficient to summon any unit, the ritual fails and no new unit is summoned.

If your summoning roll included any doubles, your character then suffers a mortal wound. If it contained any triples, it instead suffers D3 mortal wounds. ()

. [b]Hateful Assault:[/b] If this unit makes a charge move, is charged or performs a Heroic Intervention, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in this unit until the end of the turn. ()

. [b]Hateful Volleys:[/b] Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models in this unit firing Rapid Fire bolt weapons make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply:
• The firing model’s target is within half the weapon’s maximum range.
• The firing model is INFANTRY and every model in its unit remained stationary in your previous Movement phase.
• The firing model is a TERMINATOR, BIKER or HELBRUTE.
For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any bolt weapon with the Rapid Fire type. A bolt weapon is any weapon whose profile includes the word ‘bolt’ (e.g. boltgun, bolt pistol, combibolter, Inferno boltgun). Rules that apply to bolt weapons also apply when firing the boltgun profile of combi-weapons and when firing Artefacts of Chaos that replaced a bolt weapon, (e.g. Spitespitter). The Talon of Horus is also a Rapid Fire bolt weapon. ()
